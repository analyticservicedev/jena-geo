 * Thrown when the argument specified to a method or constructor would result in an invalid {@link GridGeometry}.
 * This exception may have a {@link org.opengis.referencing.operation.TransformException} as its cause, in which
 * case the grid geometry failed to use a given "grid to CRS" transform over the given grid extent. Such failure
 * may happen with non-linear transforms, but are less likely in the common case where the grid geometry uses a
 * linear (or affine) "grid to CRS" transform.
